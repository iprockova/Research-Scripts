The python code in this directory are wrappers around dummynet for modifying link characteristics.

At the moment:
* `dnet_fixed_bw.py` uses fixed values for throughput and network latency.
* `dnet_variable_bw.py` uses variable throughput (see link.txt for format), but fixed network latency.

[Work in progress]
